# Django Web Development Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress through a structured Django web development curriculum,  
where I built progressively more complex applications while mastering both fundamental and advanced concepts.

## Technical Scope

Starting with **core web technologies**, I implemented responsive layouts using **HTML5 and CSS**,  
then advanced to **form handling** with client-side validation and server-side processing.  
The projects demonstrate my **Django framework** proficiency, including the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern,  
database design with the **Django ORM**, and efficient routing with **generic class-based views**.

For **backend functionality**, I developed secure **user authentication systems**, robust **CRUD interfaces** with relational data,  
and media management features like **image uploads and processing**.  
The later assignments involved **integrating external APIs**, generating dynamic **data visualizations**,  
and optimizing the **Django admin panel** for content management.

## Technical Implementation

---

### Backend Architecture

The application follows Django's **Model-View-Template (MVT)** pattern with a **PostgreSQL** database. Key backend components include:

- **Custom Models**  
  Designed relational schemas for circuits, user profiles, comments, lap times, and quiz systems.  
  Features include:
  - Proper foreign key constraints  
  - Custom field validations (e.g., regex-based lap time format validation)

- **Authentication Flow**  
  Implemented Django‚Äôs built-in auth system:
  - Extended `User` model via `Profile`
  - Secure password hashing
  - Session-based login/logout flow

- **Dynamic Querying**  
  Utilized powerful Django ORM methods:
  - `annotate()`, `aggregate()`, `select_related()`  
  - Examples: Average circuit ratings, efficient quiz history retrieval

- **Class-Based Views (CBVs)**  
  Reused generic views:
  - `ListView`, `DetailView`, `UpdateView`
  - Integrated `LoginRequiredMixin` for access control

---

### Frontend Integration

- **Interactive Maps**  
  Integrated **Leaflet.js** into Django templates:  
  - GeoJSON data rendered dynamically  
  - Context-passed location data for real-time mapping

- **Responsive Design (Bootstrap 5)**  
  - Custom dark theme for branding  
  - Toast messages for real-time feedback  
  - Mobile-optimized navigation

- **Template Inheritance**  
  - `base.html` contains shared structure (navbar, CSS/JS)  
  - `{% block %}` structure for page-specific overrides

---

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Leaderboards**  
  - Quiz attempts ranked using `order_by()` on combined score and completion time  

- **Concurrent Data Handling**  
  - Atomic transactions ensure consistency in:
    - Lap time submissions  
    - Quiz attempts  

- **Admin Customization**  
  - Extended Django Admin:
    - Inline editing of user content  
    - Filters, search bars for quick access to models

---

### üöÄ Optimizations

- **Database Query Efficiency**  
  - Used `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` to prevent N+1 query issues

- **Form Validation**  
  - Paired client-side JS checks with server-side validation for robust data protection

- **Scalable Task Processing**  
  - Integrated **Celery** task queue (planned)
